# Funcionality of the application:
- Wallet management service - This service provides the ability for users to create and manage their digital wallets, including adding or removing funds, setting transaction limits, and viewing wallet balances and transaction histories.

- Payment processing service - This service manages the processing of transactions between wallets and ensures the security and accuracy of each transaction. This service may include features such as real-time exchange rates, automatic currency conversions, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

- Authentication and authorization service - This service provides secure and reliable authentication and authorization for users, allowing them to access their wallets and make transactions. This service may include features such as two-factor authentication, biometric authentication, and password management.

- User management service - This service provides features for managing users and their accounts, including creating new accounts, updating account information, and deleting accounts. This service may also include features for managing user roles and permissions.
                                                                                                                                         
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) - Adding an extra layer of security to the login process by requiring users to enter a unique code generated by an authenticator app on their phone or sent via SMS.

- Multisignature wallets - Allowing multiple users to control a single wallet, which increases the security of the wallet by requiring multiple users to sign off on transactions.

- Integration with external wallets - Allowing users to connect their wallets from external services such as Coinbase or Binance, to transfer funds to their digital wallets within the service.

- Automatic transaction alerts - Sending notifications to users when a transaction is initiated or completed, providing users with real-time updates on their wallet's activity.

- Transaction limits - Setting limits on the amount of digital currency that can be transferred in a single transaction or over a specific period of time to prevent fraud and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

- Cold storage - Storing users' digital currency in an offline "cold" storage wallet, which provides additional security by making it less vulnerable to hacking attempts.

- API access - Providing an API that developers can use to integrate the wallet service into their applications or websites, allowing them to accept payments in digital currency.

- Automated tax reporting - Generating reports for users that show their transaction history and any capital gains or losses, simplifying the tax reporting process.

- Social media integration - Allowing users to share their wallet activity on social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook, which could increase the adoption of the service and generate more interest in digital currency.

- Peer-to-peer payments - Enabling users to send and receive digital currency directly to and from other users of the wallet service, without the need for a traditional financial institution as an intermediary.

- These are just a few potential functionalities that could be added to the wallet service. The actual features implemented would depend on the project requirements, stakeholder needs, and other considerations.
